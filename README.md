## License

The assets included in this source release shouldn't be used. I don't remember the sources for most of these assets, and I certainly don't remember what license they were under, if any. The song is absolutely not under any sort of proper license, since I don't have a license to the song "Samurai" by FCF, nor the voice clips from Mel Gibson's Hamlet.
